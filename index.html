          <p>Hi! My name is Arnold Kochari. I currently work as a project lead at the <a href="https://scilifelab.se/data">SciLifeLab Data Centre</a>. <a href="https://scilifelab.se/">SciLifeLab</a> is a large national life science research infrastructure in Sweden. Here, I am lucky to combine my passions in open science, web development, and data science: I lead development of software tools that we offer as national services for researchers.</p>
          <p>I am based in Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪. I also studied and worked in the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.</p>

          <h4>Open science</h4>
          <p>In the age of global internet access and with tools that scientists currently have at their disposal, I believe that the only way to do science is to be as open, as reproducible, and as collaborative as possible. I am a big advocate of open data, open analysis scripts (best as a step-by-step report using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html">knitr</a> or as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook">Jupyter Notebook</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review">open peer review</a>, <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg">preregistration</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2012.12.016">registered reports</a>, preprint publication, and team science efforts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>Web development</h4>
          <p>I thoroughly enjoy building for web and have worked as a web developer on and off since my teens. For many years, I ran my own successful web development company. Nowadays, I am excited to apply my knowledge in developing tools for researchers. I am happy that we now have great open source frameworks and packages that make building for web not only easier but also fun!</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>Data science</h4>
          <p>After many years of working as a scientist doing quantitative analyses, I have become a data analysis nerd whose idea of fun at a party includes initiating a double-blind ice-cream tasting with corresponding analyses. <i>R</i> is closest to my heart. I love seeing clean and coherent <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/">tidyr</a> code or a beautiful plot resulting from just several lines of <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, the latter seamlessly turned into a <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> app with a few additional lines of code.

            <h2 class="display-6">Research output</h2>
            <p>In past, I conducted research in cognitive neuroscience, focusing on language processing by the brain. In 2020, I obtained a PhD after completing a joint project at the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/">Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation, University of Amsterdam</a> and <a href="https://www.ru.nl/donders/">Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen</a>.</p>
            <p>Some of you might be here because you are looking for a paper I (co-)wrote or for related data and code. You can find a full list of all my publications along with links to related materials <a href="/research/">on this page</a>.</p>
